# twentyfourtyeight

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.11.1.

## Build & development

1. Make sure you have *ruby* installed. On Linux you can e.g. install [RVM](https://rvm.io/), then enter the project directory with `cd 2048` (if you're already in *2048*, leave it first with `cd ..`). *RVM* will tell you what to do next.

2. Run `bundle` to install the [compass](https://github.com/Compass/compass) ruby gem automatically.

3. Install *npm* (part of [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)), if you don't have it.

4. Install back-end packages globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli bower karma-cli`

5. Still in the *2048* directory, install project-local back-end packages with `npm install`

6. Install front-end packages with `bower install`

7. Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
